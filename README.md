Objective
Build an LSTM-based model to predict the stock prices of any company using historical data. The task must be implemented entirely in a Jupyter notebook.

📊 Dataset
You can use stock data from sources like Yahoo Finance (via yfinance or pandas_datareader).

Data includes:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)

📌 Steps Involved
Load historical stock data

Preprocess data (scaling, sequence generation)

Build LSTM model

Train and evaluate

Visualize predicted vs actual prices

📍 Note
Use only Jupyter Notebook for implementation.

Focus on Close prices for prediction.

🚀 Output
Predicted future stock price trend based on past price movements using LSTM.
